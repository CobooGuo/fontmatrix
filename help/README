Fontmatrix documentation

The very first thing you need to know is that documentation is a work in progress. 

We will let you know when it's more or less settled, so that you don't waste 
your precious time on trying to paint a speeding train :-)

Anyway, this is how it works.

Every translation has its own directory named after two-letter language code, 
e.g. 'fr' fro French, 'de' for German, 'ru' for Russian etc.

Every directory has a menu.xml file that contains description of contents 
structure which is loaded to the sidebar in help browser to help navigating 
contents of the documentation.

The plan is to remove all help_LANG.html files along with shifting their 
content to lang directories. See TODO for details.
