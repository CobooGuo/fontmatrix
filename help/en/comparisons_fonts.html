<h2>Comparison of fonts</h2>

<p>When you have narrowed down your search results to maybe a dozen of fonts, you might like to compare them side by side.</p>

<h3>Adding fonts for comparison</h3>

<p>Go to <em>Playground</em> tab in the main window.</p>

<ol>
<li>In <em>Browse Fonts</em> sidebar click on a font that you want to add to comparison area.</li>
<li>Inside the tab pick a fonts size of interest.</li>
<li>Click anywhere on the canvas area. A text cursor will briefly flasj to indicate the place where your text will start.</li>
<li>Just type in some text</li>
<li>In <em>Browse Fonts</em> sidebar click on another font that you want to add to comparison area.</li>
<li>Keep repeating steps 1-5 till you are done</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comparing fonts</h3>

<p>Fontmatrix takes a somewhat unusual step away from a traditional table way 
of laying out text lines rendered with different fonts. What is suggests instead 
is a huge zoomable comparison area where you can drag text lines around, freely 
regroup them and pan around.</p>

<p>Contrary to <em>Sample Text</em> tab playground <em>always</em> uses native 
Qt font rendering engine, so you can freely zoom in and out and never see ugly 
pixel blocks.</p>

<p>Having added a dozen of text lines rendered with different fonts you surely 
might not remember which one is which. Just hover on a text line to see a tooltip 
saying which font font was used. Location and name of the font comes as a bonus.</p>

<p>To move around a rendered line of text just click on it and drag to wherever 
you want it to be. If you want to move several lines of text, press <b>Ctrl</b> 
and keep clicking on text lines until your group is selected or, if they are 
already nicely layed out, draw a rubberband frame around them to select them. 
Then drag them all elsewehere. To remove current selection just press <b>Escape</b> 
or click on blank space outside any text line.</p>

<p>Navigation in the comparison area is easy: press middle mouse button to pan 
and use <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>mouse wheel</b> to zoom in and out. You can even do both 
having a selection of text lines.</p>

<h3>Cleaning playground</h3>

<p>To remove existing text lines select them and press <b>Delete</b>.</p>
