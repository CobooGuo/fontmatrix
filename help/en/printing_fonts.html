<h2>Printing fonts</h2>

<p>Fontmatrix is currently lacking documentation on that functionality, but 
it's pretty much straightforward, so try printing to files first and you'll see 
what it looks like. Just note that Fontmatrix will scale text lines to fit the 
whole used area to a chosen paper size. That's the only tricky thing maybe.</p>
