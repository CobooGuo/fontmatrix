<h1>Editing PANOSE metadata</h1>

<p>While PANOSE metadata can really be helpful for searching for a font with desired characteristics, not all of fonts available to users contain this information for a numer of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>not all font types can contain this information (PostScript fonts do not have PANOSE table);</li>
<li>not all type designers choose to fill in this information;</li>
<li>a fair amount of type designers do not even know about PANOSE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fontmatrix provides a way to add missing and edit existing PANOSE metadata in a non-destructive way&nbsp;&mdash; by storing changes in its database rather than in font files themselves. Besides non-destructiveness it also makes your changes comply to most proprietary font licenses.</p>

<p>Pick the font which is missing PANOSE metadata or contains incorrect data and choose "Edit&nbsp;â†’ Edit PANOSE metadata". In the newly opened dialog choose new values for PANOSE variables of interest and click "OK" to submit changes or "Cancel" to revert your changes and return to the main window. Return to "Font Information" tab to look at the PANOSE summary in the right column. From now on whenever you search for fonts using PANOSE metadata these changes will be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Currently there is no way to reset applied changes other than reimporting a font. Please refer to "Managing fonts collection" chapter to find out how to do it.</p>
