<h2>Editing PANOSE metadata</h2>

<p>While PANOSE metadata can really be helpful for searching for a font with desired characteristics, not all of fonts available to users contain this information for a numer of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>not all font types can contain this information (PostScript fonts do not have PANOSE table);</li>
<li>not all type designers care to fill in this information;</li>
<li>a fair amount of type designers do not even know about PANOSE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes PANOSE metadata is present, but incorrect.</p>

<p>Fontmatrix provides a way to add missing and edit existing PANOSE metadata in a non-destructive way&nbsp;&mdash; by storing changes in its database rather than in font files themselves. Besides this non-destructiveness also makes your changes comply to most proprietary font licenses.</p>

<p>Pick the font which is missing PANOSE metadata or contains incorrect data and choose <em>Edit&nbsp;&gt; Edit PANOSE metadata</em>. In the newly opened dialog choose new values for PANOSE variables of interest and click <b>OK</b> to submit changes or <b>Cancel</b> to revert your changes and return to the main window. Return to <em>Font Information</em> tab to look at the PANOSE summary in the right column. From now on whenever you search for fonts using PANOSE metadata, these changes will be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Currently there is no way to reset applied changes other than reimporting a font. Please refer to <a href="management.html">"Managing fonts collection"</a> chapter to find out how to do it.</p>
