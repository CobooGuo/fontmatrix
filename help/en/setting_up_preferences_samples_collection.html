<h2>Samples collection</h2>

<p>Fontmatrix ships with a set of sample texts for a number of languages, so that you have something to start with. But if you want to use your own sample texts, you can add them here.</p>

<p>Start with giving the sample text a name by typing it into a filed just below the list of custom sample text and clicking the <em>"+"</em> button. Thenew sample text's caption will appear in the list above. Now go to the text entry field and paste your text, then click the <em>"Save"</em> button. The text will be added to the list of available sample texts in <em>"Display options"</em> tab inside <em>"Sample Text"</em> area.</p>

<p>If you need to remove a custom sample text, choose it in the listbox and click <em>"-"</em> button. This operation cannot be undone.</p>

<p>Just in case you are curious, all sample texts are stored as plain text file in the home directory (which is <tt>~/.Fontmatrix/Samples/</tt> on Linux).</p>
