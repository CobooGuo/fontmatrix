<h2>Using tags</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Tags are a great and flexible way to manage your fonts collection, because they don't set restrictions on a way you categorize fonts. You can use tags like "Fonts I bought from AGFA before it was acquired" or "Slab serif fonts my wife hates" or "Fake italic fonts I wouldn't use for my own dear mother" or "Fonts I designed for COMPANY_NAME" or "Serif high contrast text fonts I'm allowed to embed".</p>

<h3>How to add tags</h3>

<p>There are two ways to add new tags.</p>

<p>The first one is when you add a directory containing fonts (and the "Ask for tag names when importing fonts" options in Preferences is enabled). You will be presented with this dialog:</p>

<p><img src="images/importing_set_tags_1.png" /></p>

<p>So this dialog lists all the tags Fontmatrix knows about and allows you to pick one of them and/or add a new one. For the latter just enter name of a new tag and click <b>Add</b> button. The newly created tag will be automatically used for the fonts you are about to import:</p>

<p>Later when you select a font that has some custom (that is, created by you) tag, the <em>"Tags"</em> pane will have this tag listed:</p>

<p><img src="images/list_of_tags.png" /></p>

<p>What is really useful is a massive assigning of tags. Here is how you do it.</p>
