<h1>Text layout engine options</h1>

<p>Fontmatrix uses its own text layout engine (TLE) to support advanced OpenType features. When the TLE looks for best break, it builds a list of possibilities and attaches the difference between the break node and the line width to each node. At the end it selects the list that has the little distance.</p>

<p>Since the TLE has a number of variables you could tune, they can be customized to your liking. Use "Edit - Text layout engine options" command to open the dialog.</p>

<p><b>TODO: a screenshot</b></p>

<p>The dialog is very much like an audio equalizer: you change weights of each variable, dragging slider up and down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Before&nbsp;&mdash; factor applied to a break node that comes before the first OUT_OF_LINE node</li>
<li>Exact&nbsp;&mdash; factor applied to the first OUT_OF_LINE node</li>
<li>After&nbsp;&mdash; factor applied to nodes that come after the first OUT_OF_LINE node</li>
<li>End&nbsp;&mdash; factor same for the last line of the paragraph</li>
<li>H-penalty&nbsp;&mdash; super factor applied to the node score, if it is an hyphen node</li>
<li>Max. compression&nbsp;&mdash; <b>TODO</b></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have managed to read till this sentence, you are Pierre Marchand&nbsp;&mdash; lead Fontmatrix developer. It also means that the text was never improved to become human readable. So go and fix this, will you? :) In the unlikely case of you not being Pierre please report to the bug tracker.</p>
