<p>For this purpose three means are at your disposal.</p>

<p>The first one is to select the entry <em>Import...</em> from the <em>File menu</em>. It 
will then be asked to choose a directory, which will be explored in order to 
import the files it contains iron&nbsp;&mdash; a way to ease, Fontmatrix 
conducting a recursion in the directories contained in the one you have chosen.</p>

<p>The second is to import a choice of files in Fontmatrix and do a <em>drag-drop</em>.</p>

<p>And the third one is to use context menu for files and folders in the <em>Folders</em> tab inside the <em>Browse Fonts</em> sidebar.</p>
