<h2>Glyphs chart</h2>

<p>In <em>Glyphs</em> mode Fontmatrix can display a chart of glyphs present in 
a currently selected font. It also groups glyphs into Unicode blocks and 
displays coverage of that block in %.</p>

<p>Clicking on a glyph in the chart will display its larger version with 
metrics and category.</p>

<p>If you are not sure which block holds the glyph of interest, switch to 
<em>View all mapped glyphs</em> grouping and in the search filed to the right 
type in beginning of the glyph's name. Fontmatrix will automatically complete 
the name and if the glyph is present, it will scroll the chart and flash that 
glyph a while.</p>

<p>Clicking <em>Copy Mode</em> button activates the entry field which you can 
use as a digital letter case. Just enable it and start clicking on glyphs to 
copy them into that field. Then select all copied characters and copy them to 
clipboard to paste elsewhere.</p>
