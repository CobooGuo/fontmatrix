* FIXES:
  - performance issues
  - usability issues
  - ugly code
   
* BACKEND:
  - replace fontmatrix backend (activation / deactivation,
    tags database, etc.) with a third party one or even write 
    this more general purpose font management library in order
    to focus on presentation in fontmatrix itself.

* FEATURES:
  - continue to listen Vlada!
