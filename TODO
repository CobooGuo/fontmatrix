_PIERRE_

* FIXES:
  - performance issues
  - usability issues
  - ugly code
  - render glyphs with Freetype, Qt doesn’t handle it very well :(
  - split main window into View and Data (or whatever it’s called by actual developers;-)
  - change left pane into a docked widget (DONE 0.3 but I dont like it - Vlada)
   
* BACKEND:
  - replace fontmatrix backend (activation / deactivation,
    tags database, etc.) with a third party one or even write 
    this more general purpose font management library in order
    to focus on presentation in fontmatrix itself.

* FEATURES:
  - continue to listen Vlada!
  - Write an up to date help page


_VLADA_

* MISC:
  - tweak fontmatrix.desktop file to make correct menu entery
  - the same goes for src.pro (need help here Pierre). I can't figure out how to install various size icons
  - decide wether 'splash' shoud be turned on (Pierre...?)

* UI:
  - draw nice icons for zoom [DONE 0.2]
  - make Info, Tags, Glyphs etc. icons [DONE 0.2]

* WEB:
  - mockup site
  - make it!

----------------

_MASA_ (my girlfriend :) )

* allow browsing through fontlist tab using arrow keys
* fit character width into glyph cell (good candidate is the font Blackoak Std Regular)
* move font name above Info, Glyph, etc. tabs so it's always visible


_RIKU_

* allow font import with dnd to systray icon
* synchronize main window and systray activation/deactivation information
