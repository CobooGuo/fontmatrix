Fontmatrix is a font management application conceieved by Pierre Marchand in 2007.

It helps keeping your font collection in order, allowing you to enable and 
disable availability of fonts and font families in you system. This is a quite 
helpful tool for designers who tend to have huge collections of typefaces.

Fontmatrix is also useful for type designers and enthusiasts, because it 
simplifies testing of OpenType features and allows comparing fonts glyph by 
glyph which is extremely useful for learning type design.
