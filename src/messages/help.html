<h3>Importing fonts</h3>
<p>The very first thing to do once you have Fontmatrix up and running is to import uninstalled fonts that you want to manage with Fontmatrix.<br/>
This is done by File->Import... You will be prompt to choose a directory containing your fonts --- as a facility, it will recurse one time over directories. Once there are imported, the fonts are not activated.</p>
