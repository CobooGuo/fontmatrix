Here is a quick overview of what you need to do in order
to have fontmatrix up an running.
 ---OLD---------------------------------------------------------
|                                 You’ll see mentions of        |
|"typotek" here and there, it was the first name of this        |
|project, and some files had kept the name - don’t worry.       |
 -----------------------------text kept for historians----------

Requirements :
	- Qt 4.3
	- Freetype2
*not to mention that you need the devel- packages.
	
	
 ---OLD---------------------------------------------------------
|Run "qmake -o Makefile typotek.pro" (be sure you use the qmake |
|from Qt4 (for OpenSuse users, it means you just run qmake if   |
|Qt4 is installed)),                                            |
|then "make" (fontmatrix binary will be in ./bin/),             |
|then do _not_ run "make install" ;-)[NOTE: Vlada made efforts  |
|to improve a lot the way it installs, so you should give       |
|it a try (maybe with checkinstall?) and thus report any issue. |
|Default installation directory is /usr/bin and if all went     |
|right, you should see a new entry somewhere in your app. menu  |
|as we provide a .desktop file.]                                |

Switched to CMake, so build instructions are now - assuming
you’re in fontmatrix source tree and want to build out source:
 $ mkdir ../fontmatrix-build
 $ cd ../fontmatrix-build
 $ cmake ../fontmatrix
 $ make
 
At this point, the fontmatrix binary is in fontmatrix-build/src/
directory, if you want, you can try to install it.
Two methods here :

1/ the most common (which can fail sometimes because, as Fm is at 
its baby state, "install" target is not what we mostly pay attention for)
 # make install DESTDIR="/where/you/want"

2/ build a binary archive (tar.gz) that one can check with
"tar tvzf fontmatrix.x.x.x.tagr.gz" or his prefered archive manager 
(here it’s ark under KDE.). Then extract it where you want.
 $ make package

(note) all resources are now built into the binary, so you can
run fontmatrix without bother to the search path for icons,
help files, etc. In near future, it will change as of growing
resources would make the binary a fatty one. In other words :
"stay tuned!"

Now, you can run Fontmatrix and read the help in help->help.

|If you are familiar with cmake and interested in this project, |
|a reliable cmakelist.txt would be very much appreciated!       |

I made it myself ;-) but if you’re quite the cmake (wo)man, it’d be
great if you’d check what I wrote.
