Here is a quick overview of what you need to do in order
to have fontmatrix up an running.

Requirements :
	- Qt 4.3
	- Freetype2
*not to mention that you need the developpement packages.
	

Build instructions are:
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..  [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug] [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/prefix] [-DWANT_HARFBUZZ=1] [-DWANT_ICU=1] [-DWANT_M17N=1]
 $ make
 
At this point, the fontmatrix binary is in build/src/
directory, if you want, you can try to install it (default 
installation path is /usr/local) with:
 $ make install
