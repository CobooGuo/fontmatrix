Here is a quick overview of what you need to do in order
to have fontmatrix up an running. You’ll see mentions of
"typotek" here and there, it was the first name of this
project, and some files had kept the name.

Requirements :
	-- Qt 4.3
	-- Freetype2 [We don’t search for it, but just assert it
	is in /usr/include/freetype2. If your installation differs,
	just change path accordingly at line 47 of src/src.pro file]
	
 ---OLD---------------------------------------------------------
|Run "qmake -o Makefile typotek.pro" (be sure you use the qmake |
|from Qt4 (for OpenSuse users, it means you just run qmake if   |
|Qt4 is installed)),                                            |
|then "make" (fontmatrix binary will be in ./bin/),             |
|then do _not_ run "make install" ;-)[NOTE: Vlada made efforts  |
|to improve a lot the way it installs, so you should give       |
|it a try (maybe with checkinstall?) and thus report any issue. |
|Default installation directory is /usr/bin and if all went     |
|right, you should see a new entry somewhere in your app. menu  |
|as we provide a .desktop file.]                                |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

Switched to CMake, so build instructions are now - assuming
you’re in fontmatrix source tree and want to build out source:
 $ mkdir ../fontmatrix-build
 $ cd ../fontmatrix-build
 $ cmake ../fontmatrix
 $ make
 # make install DESTDIR="/where/you/want"

Now, you can run Fontmatrix and read the help in help->help.

If you are familiar with cmake and interested this project,
a reliable cmakelist.txt would be very much appreciated!
