Requirements :
	-- Qt 4.3
	-- Freetype2
	
Run "qmake -o Makefile typotek.pro",
then "make" (typotek will be in ./bin/),
then do _not_ run "make install" ;-)


It should work as is with OpenSuse 10.3. For other configurations,
you might have to alter the pro files (typotek.pro & src/src.pro).
If you are familiar with cmake and interesting in this project,
a reliable cmakelist.txt would be very much appreciated! 
If you encounter problems or just have questions or if you have 
suggestions, please take time to suscribe to the undertype-users
mailing list ( https://mail.gna.org/listinfo/undertype-users ).
